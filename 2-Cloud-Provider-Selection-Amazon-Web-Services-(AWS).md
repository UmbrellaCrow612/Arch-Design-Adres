# ADR: Cloud Provider Selection - Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team needs to select a cloud provider for hosting our new library management system web application. The chosen platform must provide reliable infrastructure, scalable services, and a comprehensive suite of tools to support our application's needs. We need to ensure that the selected provider aligns with our technical requirements, budget constraints, and long-term growth plans.

## Decision Drivers

* Scalability and reliability to handle varying loads
* Comprehensive suite of services (compute, storage, database, networking, etc.)
* Cost-effectiveness and flexible pricing models
* Strong security features and compliance certifications
* Integration capabilities with our existing tools and workflows
* Availability of managed services to reduce operational overhead

## Considered Options

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* DigitalOcean

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Amazon Web Services (AWS)", because it offers the most comprehensive and mature set of services, has a strong track record of reliability, and provides the best balance of features, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for our needs.

### Consequences

* Good, because AWS provides a wide range of services that can support all aspects of our application.
* Good, because it offers excellent scalability options to handle growth in user base and data.
* Good, because it has a large community and extensive documentation, which will aid in development and problem-solving.
* Good, because it provides strong security features and compliance certifications required for handling library data.
* Bad, because it may have a steeper learning curve for team members not familiar with AWS.
* Bad, because it could potentially lead to vendor lock-in if we heavily utilize AWS-specific services.

### Confirmation

We will confirm this decision by:
1. Creating a proof-of-concept deployment of our application on AWS, utilizing key services like EC2, RDS, and S3.
2. Conducting a cost analysis based on our projected usage and comparing it with other providers.
3. Testing the integration of AWS services with our existing development and deployment pipelines.
4. Reviewing the decision with the development and operations teams to ensure alignment and identify any training needs.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

* Good, because it offers the most comprehensive set of services and tools.
* Good, because it has a strong track record of reliability and performance.
* Good, because it provides flexible pricing options, including reserved instances for cost optimization.
* Good, because it has extensive documentation and a large community for support.
* Neutral, because while powerful, some services may be complex to configure and manage.
* Bad, because it may lead to higher costs if resources are not managed carefully.

### Microsoft Azure

* Good, because it integrates well with other Microsoft products and services.
* Good, because it offers a strong set of services comparable to AWS.
* Good, because it provides good support for hybrid cloud setups.
* Bad, because it may have less extensive documentation and community support compared to AWS.
* Bad, because some services may not be as mature as their AWS counterparts.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

* Good, because it offers innovative features, especially in areas like machine learning and data analytics.
* Good, because it often provides simpler pricing models.
* Good, because it has strong container and Kubernetes support.
* Bad, because it has a smaller market share, which may result in less community support and fewer third-party tools.
* Bad, because it may not have as wide a range of services as AWS or Azure.

### DigitalOcean

* Good, because it offers simplicity and ease of use, especially for smaller projects.
* Good, because it often has more straightforward pricing.
* Bad, because it has a more limited set of services compared to the larger cloud providers.
* Bad, because it may not provide the level of scalability and advanced features required for our application.

## More Information

The decision to use AWS will be revisited annually to evaluate its performance, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with our evolving needs. We will also invest in AWS training and certification for our team to ensure we're utilizing the platform effectively.

For implementation, we will:
1. Create an AWS account and set up proper IAM roles and permissions.
2. Design our cloud architecture using AWS best practices.
3. Set up a staging environment on AWS to mirror our production setup.
4. Implement monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch.
5. Develop a cost management strategy using AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer.

This decision aligns with our strategy to build a scalable, reliable, and secure platform for our library management system. It also positions us to leverage advanced cloud services as our application evolves.
