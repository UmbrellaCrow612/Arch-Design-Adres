# ADR: ORM Selection - Entity Framework Core

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team needs to select an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for our web application to simplify database interactions, improve development productivity, and provide a clean abstraction layer between our application's domain model and the database.

## Decision Drivers

* Ease of database interaction and maintenance
* Performance and efficiency
* Compatibility with our chosen PostgreSQL database
* Integration with our .NET ecosystem
* Community support and long-term maintainability

## Considered Options

* Entity Framework Core
* Dapper
* NHibernate
* ADO.NET

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Entity Framework Core", because it provides comprehensive ORM capabilities, strong .NET integration, and robust features for our library management system.

### Consequences

* Good, because it offers rich domain modeling capabilities
* Good, because of deep integration with .NET ecosystem
* Good, because it supports complex queries and database migrations
* Bad, because it may have slight performance overhead compared to micro-ORMs
* Bad, because it requires careful performance optimization

### Confirmation

We will confirm this decision by:
1. Implementing a proof-of-concept with complex domain models
2. Performing performance benchmarks
3. Validating database migration and code-first approach capabilities

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Entity Framework Core

* Good, because it provides comprehensive ORM features
* Good, because of native .NET support and seamless integration
* Good, because it supports multiple database providers
* Good, because of built-in migration and scaffolding tools
* Neutral, because it has a learning curve for complex scenarios
* Bad, because of potential performance overhead for very complex queries

### Dapper

* Good, because of exceptional performance
* Good, because it's lightweight and simple
* Bad, because it lacks advanced ORM features
* Bad, because it requires more manual query writing

### NHibernate

* Good, because of mature ORM capabilities
* Bad, because of complex configuration
* Bad, because it's less integrated with modern .NET ecosystem

### ADO.NET

* Good, because of direct, low-level database access
* Bad, because it requires manual data mapping
* Bad, because of increased development complexity

## More Information

The decision to use Entity Framework Core will be revisited annually to assess its continued suitability. We will:
1. Implement best practices for performance optimization
2. Invest in team training
3. Continuously evaluate alternative ORM approaches

This decision aligns with our strategy of using robust, well-supported frameworks that improve developer productivity and maintainability.
