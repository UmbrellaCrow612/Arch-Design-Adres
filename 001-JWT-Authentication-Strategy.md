# ADR: JWT Authentication Strategy

## Context and Problem Statement
We need a secure, scalable authentication mechanism for our web application that supports stateless authentication, enables microservices architecture, and provides flexibility for future authentication requirements.

## Decision Drivers
* Stateless authentication support
* Horizontal scalability
* Reduced server-side session management
* Support for distributed systems
* Token-based authorization
* Performance efficiency

## Considered Options
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Session-based Authentication
* OAuth 2.0
* OpenID Connect
* Custom Token Authentication

## Decision Outcome
Chosen Option: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### Consequences
* Good, because of stateless authentication
* Good, because of easy horizontal scalability
* Good, because of built-in claim-based authorization
* Bad, because tokens are larger compared to session IDs
* Bad, because token revocation requires additional mechanisms

## Implementation Strategy
1. Use asymmetric key signing (RS256)
2. Implement short-lived access tokens
3. Use refresh tokens for extended sessions
4. Store minimal claims in tokens
5. Implement token rotation mechanism

## Security Considerations
* Use short token expiration times
* Implement secure token storage on client-side
* Validate all token claims server-side
* Use HTTPS for all token exchanges
* Implement token blacklisting for revocation

## Token Configuration
* Access Token Lifetime: 15 minutes
* Refresh Token Lifetime: 7 days
* Signing Algorithm: RSA 256-bit
* Claims to Include:
  - User ID
  - Roles/Permissions
  - Issued At timestamp
  - Expiration timestamp

## Potential Risks
* Token theft if not properly secured
* Increased complexity of token management
* Performance overhead of frequent token validation

## Mitigation Strategies
* Use short-lived tokens
* Implement robust token storage mechanisms
* Use secure random generators for token creation
* Regular security audits of authentication flow

## Future Considerations
* Evaluate token management libraries
* Monitor performance impact
* Consider multi-factor authentication integration
* Explore advanced token encryption techniques

## Decision Validation
1. Conduct security penetration testing
2. Benchmark authentication performance
3. Develop comprehensive test suite for token handling
4. Create detailed documentation for implementation

## More Information
Recommended Libraries:
- `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt`
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`

This strategy provides a robust, scalable authentication mechanism aligned with modern distributed system requirements.
