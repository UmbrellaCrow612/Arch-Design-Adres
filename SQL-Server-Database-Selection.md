# ADR: SQL Server Database Selection

## Context and Problem Statement
Select a robust, enterprise-grade relational database management system that supports our organization's data storage, complex querying, and scalability requirements.

## Decision Drivers
* Enterprise-level reliability
* Advanced security features
* Complex query performance
* Windows and .NET ecosystem integration
* Comprehensive tooling support
* Scalability and high availability
* Cloud and on-premises deployment flexibility

## Considered Options
* SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Oracle Database
* MariaDB

## Decision Outcome
Chosen Option: Microsoft SQL Server

### Consequences
* Good, because of deep .NET integration
* Good, because of comprehensive enterprise features
* Good, because of advanced security capabilities
* Bad, because of potential licensing costs
* Bad, because of Windows-centric ecosystem dependency

## Key Selection Criteria

### Technical Capabilities
* Advanced indexing strategies
* In-memory OLTP capabilities
* Column-store indexing
* Always Encrypted feature
* Robust backup and recovery mechanisms
* Comprehensive query optimization

### Deployment Strategies
* Support for hybrid cloud/on-premises environments
* Azure SQL Database compatibility
* Containerization support
* Scalable architecture

### Performance Considerations
* Columnstore indexes
* In-memory OLTP tables
* Query Store for performance tracking
* Automatic tuning capabilities

## Security Features
* Row-level security
* Dynamic data masking
* Always Encrypted technology
* Transparent data encryption
* Advanced threat protection

## Scalability Approach
* Vertical scaling capabilities
* Horizontal scaling through sharding
* Availability groups
* Failover cluster instances

## Cost Considerations
* Licensing model analysis
* Total cost of ownership evaluation
* Potential volume discounts
* Compare Standard vs. Enterprise editions

## Implementation Recommendations
1. Use latest SQL Server version
2. Implement least-privilege access model
3. Configure robust backup strategies
4. Enable advanced security features
5. Optimize for specific workload characteristics

## Monitoring and Management
* Use SQL Server Management Studio
* Implement performance dashboards
* Regular index and query optimization
* Continuous performance monitoring

## Future Evaluation Criteria
* Cloud migration readiness
* Container and microservices compatibility
* Machine learning integration capabilities
* Emerging feature support

## Risks and Mitigation
* Vendor lock-in: Maintain abstraction layers
* Licensing costs: Carefully manage editions
* Performance overhead: Regular performance tuning

## Decision Validation
1. Proof of concept implementation
2. Performance benchmark testing
3. Security configuration review
4. Cost-benefit analysis

Recommended Editions:
- Development: SQL Server Developer Edition
- Production: SQL Server Enterprise Edition

This strategy provides a comprehensive approach to SQL Server adoption, balancing technical capabilities with strategic considerations.
