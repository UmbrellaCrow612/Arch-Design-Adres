# ADR: Database Provider Decision - PostgreSQL

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team needs to select a database management system for our new web application for the library management system. The application requires a robust, scalable, and feature-rich database that can handle complex queries, support transactions, and provide good performance for both read and write operations. We need to choose a database that aligns with our technical requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability goals.

## Decision Drivers

* Scalability and performance for handling large datasets and complex queries
* Support for ACID transactions and data integrity
* Compatibility with our existing technology stack
* Long-term maintainability and community support
* Cost-effectiveness for both development and production environments

## Considered Options

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* Oracle Database

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "PostgreSQL", because it offers the best balance of features, performance, and compatibility with our needs while being open-source and cost-effective.

### Consequences

* Good, because PostgreSQL provides excellent support for complex queries and transactions.
* Good, because it has a strong community and extensive documentation, which will aid in development and troubleshooting.
* Good, because it's open-source, reducing licensing costs compared to proprietary options.
* Bad, because it may require additional training for team members more familiar with other databases.
* Bad, because it might have slightly lower read performance compared to some NoSQL options for certain use cases.

### Confirmation

We will confirm this decision by:
1. Conducting a proof-of-concept implementation using PostgreSQL with our application's most critical database operations.
2. Performing benchmark tests to ensure it meets our performance requirements.
3. Reviewing the decision with the development team to ensure everyone is comfortable with the choice and identifying any necessary training.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### PostgreSQL

* Good, because it offers robust support for ACID transactions and data integrity.
* Good, because it has excellent support for complex queries and joins.
* Good, because it's highly extensible with many built-in and community-developed extensions.
* Good, because it's open-source and has no licensing costs.
* Neutral, because its performance is generally good but may require more tuning for optimal results compared to some alternatives.
* Bad, because it may have a steeper learning curve for developers more familiar with other databases.

### MySQL

* Good, because it's widely used and many developers are familiar with it.
* Good, because it generally offers good read performance.
* Neutral, because it's open-source but has different licensing considerations depending on the version used.
* Bad, because it has historically had less robust support for complex queries and transactions compared to PostgreSQL.

### MongoDB

* Good, because it offers high performance for read-heavy workloads.
* Good, because it provides flexibility with its schema-less design.
* Bad, because it has limited support for complex joins and transactions compared to relational databases.
* Bad, because it may not be the best fit for applications requiring strict data consistency.

### Oracle Database

* Good, because it offers enterprise-level features and support.
* Good, because it has excellent performance and scalability for large-scale applications.
* Bad, because it has high licensing costs.
* Bad, because it may introduce vendor lock-in.

## More Information

The decision to use PostgreSQL will be revisited in 6 months to evaluate its performance in production and address any unforeseen issues. We will also invest in PostgreSQL training for the development team to ensure we're utilizing the database to its full potential.

For implementation, we will:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database in our development environment.
2. Migrate our existing data model to PostgreSQL.
3. Optimize our application's database queries for PostgreSQL.
4. Conduct thorough testing to ensure compatibility and performance.

This decision is aligned with our overall strategy to prefer open-source solutions where they meet our requirements, to reduce costs and benefit from community-driven development.
