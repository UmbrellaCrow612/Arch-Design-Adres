# ADR: N-Tier Architecture Adoption

## Context and Problem Statement
Our team needs a robust, scalable, and maintainable application architecture that provides clear separation of concerns, enables easy scalability, and supports complex enterprise-level application requirements.

## Decision Drivers
* Clear separation of responsibilities
* Improved maintainability
* Enhanced scalability
* Simplified development and testing
* Flexibility for future enhancements
* Modular component design

## Considered Options
* Monolithic Architecture
* Microservices Architecture
* N-Tier Architecture
* Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture
* Clean Architecture

## Decision Outcome
Chosen Option: N-Tier Architecture (Specifically 3-Tier Architecture)

### Consequences
* Good, because of clear separation of concerns
* Good, because of improved maintainability
* Good, because of easier horizontal scaling
* Bad, because of potential increased complexity in communication between layers
* Bad, because of potential performance overhead due to inter-layer communication

## Architecture Layers
1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Handles user interface and user interactions
   - Implements client-side logic
   - Responsible for rendering views and capturing user input

2. **Business Logic Layer (Application Layer)**
   - Implements core business rules and logic
   - Coordinates between presentation and data access layers
   - Handles validation, processing, and application-specific workflows

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Manages database interactions
   - Implements data retrieval and persistence
   - Abstracts database-specific operations

## Implementation Strategy
1. Use dependency injection for loose coupling
2. Implement clear interfaces between layers
3. Utilize repository pattern for data access
4. Implement service abstraction in business logic layer
5. Use DTO (Data Transfer Objects) for layer communication

## Technology Stack Recommendations
* Frontend: React or Angular
* Backend: .NET Core or Java Spring
* Database: PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server
* ORM: Entity Framework Core or Hibernate

## Scalability Considerations
* Implement caching mechanisms
* Use load balancers for horizontal scaling
* Design stateless components where possible
* Optimize inter-layer communication

## Performance Optimization
* Minimize direct database calls
* Implement efficient caching strategies
* Use lazy loading for complex objects
* Optimize database queries
* Consider using read replicas for heavy read operations

## Security Considerations
* Implement authentication at presentation layer
* Use secure communication between layers
* Validate and sanitize data at each layer boundary
* Implement proper error handling and logging
* Use principle of least privilege

## Potential Risks
* Increased complexity in layer communication
* Potential performance bottlenecks
* Complexity in maintaining layer boundaries
* Risk of tight coupling if not implemented carefully

## Mitigation Strategies
* Rigorous code reviews
* Comprehensive unit and integration testing
* Clear architectural guidelines
* Regular performance profiling
* Continuous refactoring and optimization

## Future Considerations
* Evaluate potential migration to microservices
* Monitor performance and scalability
* Explore modern architectural patterns
* Consider cloud-native adaptation strategies

## Decision Validation
1. Develop proof of concept
2. Conduct architectural review
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Document architectural decisions and guidelines
